My name is Bernardita Ried and I am curious by nature. I am 24 years old and I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Physics at the University of Chile because I love learning.

- I want to understand the cosmos through astronomical observations and contrast them with theoretical models.
- I program in Python, Matlab and Latex. Someday in C++.
- I am committed to science education and outreach. In April 2020 I founded a [free online pre-university website of mathematics](https://www.preuencuarentena.com/) because of the COVID19 pandemic and I am a popularizer of [CATA](http://www.cata.cl/).
- Every day I realize the less I know about the world.
- I love being a woman.

#### Cosmology and Theoretical Astrophysics Group
I am part of the [Cosmology and Theoretical Astrophysics](http://www.dfi.uchile.cl/grupos-investigacion/cosmologia-y-astrofisica-teorica/) group of the [Physics Department](http://www.dfi.uchile.cl/) of the University of Chile. We have seminars (+ cosmopizzas), journal clubs and more activities. Feel free send me an email to communicate with us.

#### Research Interest
I am interested in using cosmological observations to better understand our universe in order to define a more accurate theory of fundamental physics. To accomplish this goal, I am constantly studying statistical methods and new artificial intelligence tools.
I am currently doing research on flat priors in the connection of Galaxies with Matter using data from the [Dark Energy Survey (DES)](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/). 
I also collaborate in [ALeRCE](http://alerce.science/) in the area of Type Ia Supernova classification.

I am currently a member of the [Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC)](https://lsstdesc.org/) at the [Vera Rubin](https://www.lsst.org/) observatory.

#### Hobbies
I love taking pictures (you can see my selection), talking, cooking and waking up early. I like to drink coffee with milk before going to the national stadium, where I throw javelin and train with my university team. My favorite fruit are bananas.
