In this picture I am with my lovely friend Martin in our graduation! I am holding my two degrees <3 


Hi! I am an astronomer and physicist interested in applying statistical and artificial intelligence methods to cosmological observations. At the moment, I am a Master student in physics at the University of Chile (Domenico Sapone is my advisor) and a Program Student at the University of Munich (I am currently visiting Daniel Gruen's group at USM). I have obtained a Fulbright scholarship to continue my PhD studies at the US. In September 2022 I will start a PhD in Physics (mention in Astrophysics) at Stanford University.

##### ITEM Priors
I am currently leading a research in which we are rethinking the way we do statistical inference due to the an effect called Prior Volume effect. We are validating the pipeline using simulations from DESY1 to improve the connection between galaxies and matter. Due to a problem with the data, we expect to make our results public in January 2022.

- I want to understand the cosmos through astronomical observations and contrast them with theoretical models.
- I program in Python, Matlab and Latex. Someday in C++.
- I am committed to science education and outreach. In April 2020 I founded a [free online pre-university website of mathematics](https://www.preuencuarentena.com/) because of the COVID19 pandemic and I am a science communicator of [CATA](http://www.cata.cl/).

Updated December 2021.

#### Cosmology and Theoretical Astrophysics Group
I am part of the [Cosmology and Theoretical Astrophysics group](http://www.dfi.uchile.cl/grupos-investigacion/cosmologia-y-astrofisica-teorica/) of the [Physics Department](http://www.dfi.uchile.cl/) of the University of Chile. We have seminars (+ cosmopizzas), journal clubs and more activities. Feel free send me an email to communicate with us.

#### Astrophysics, Cosmology, and Artificial Intelligence (ACAI) Group
I am also part of the Astrophysics, Cosmology, and Artificial Intelligence group lead by [Daniel Gruen](https://www.physik.lmu.de/en/about-us/people/gruen-2.html) at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München. I am visiting Munich for 6 months funded by a DAAD short research grant.


#### Research Interest
I am interested in using cosmological observations to better understand our universe in order to define a more accurate theory of fundamental physics. To accomplish this goal, I am constantly studying statistical methods and new artificial intelligence tools.
I am currently doing research on flat priors in the connection of Galaxies with Matter using data from the [Dark Energy Survey (DES)](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/). 
I also collaborate in [ALeRCE](http://alerce.science/) broker (from LSST) in the area of Type Ia Supernova classification.

I am currently a member of the [Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC)](https://lsstdesc.org/) at the [Vera Rubin](https://www.lsst.org/) observatory.
