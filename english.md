In this picture I am with my lovely friend Martin in our graduation! I am holding my two BSc degrees <3 


Hi! I am an astronomer and physicist in formation interested in applying statistical and artificial intelligence methods to cosmological observations. At the moment, I am a PhD student in physics (mention in Astrophysics) at Stanford University and I recently graduated from a Master in physics at the University of Chile (Domenico Sapone was my advisor).

##### ITEM Priors
I am currently leading a research in which we are rethinking the way we do statistical inference due to the an effect called Prior Volume effect. We are validating the pipeline using simulations from DESY1 to improve the connection between galaxies and matter. 

- I want to understand the cosmos through astronomical observations and contrast them with theoretical models.
- I program in Python, Matlab and Latex. Someday in C++.
- I am committed to science education and outreach. In April 2020 I founded a [free online pre-university website of mathematics](https://www.preuencuarentena.com/) because of the COVID19 pandemic and I am a science communicator of [CATA](http://www.cata.cl/).

Updated August 2022.

#### Cosmology and Theoretical Astrophysics Group
I was part of the [Cosmology and Theoretical Astrophysics group](http://www.dfi.uchile.cl/grupos-investigacion/cosmologia-y-astrofisica-teorica/) of the [Physics Department](http://www.dfi.uchile.cl/) of the University of Chile. 

#### Astrophysics, Cosmology, and Artificial Intelligence (ACAI) Group
I was also part of the Astrophysics, Cosmology, and Artificial Intelligence group lead by [Daniel Gruen](https://www.physik.lmu.de/en/about-us/people/gruen-2.html) at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München.


#### Research Interest
I am interested in using cosmological observations to better understand our universe in order to define a more accurate theory of fundamental physics. To accomplish this goal, I am constantly studying statistical methods and new artificial intelligence tools.
I am currently doing research on flat priors in the connection of Galaxies with Matter using data from the [Dark Energy Survey (DES)](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/). 
I also collaborate in [ALeRCE](http://alerce.science/) broker (from LSST) in the area of Type Ia Supernova classification.

I am currently a member of the [Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC)](https://lsstdesc.org/) at the [Vera Rubin](https://www.lsst.org/) observatory.
