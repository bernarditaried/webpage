In this picture I am with my lovely friend Martin in our graduation! 


Hi! I am an astronomer and physicist interested in applying statistical and artificial intelligence methods to cosmological observations. At the moment, I am a Master student in physics at the University of Chile (Domenico Sapone is my advisor) and a Program Student at the University of Munich (I am currently visiting Daniel Gruen's group at USM). I have obtained a Fulbright scholarship to continue my PhD studies in the USA.

- I want to understand the cosmos through astronomical observations and contrast them with theoretical models.
- I program in Python, Matlab and Latex. Someday in C++.
- I am committed to science education and outreach. In April 2020 I founded a [free online pre-university website of mathematics](https://www.preuencuarentena.com/) because of the COVID19 pandemic and I am a science communicator of [CATA](http://www.cata.cl/).

Updated October 2021.

#### Cosmology and Theoretical Astrophysics Group
I am part of the [Cosmology and Theoretical Astrophysics group](http://www.dfi.uchile.cl/grupos-investigacion/cosmologia-y-astrofisica-teorica/) of the [Physics Department](http://www.dfi.uchile.cl/) of the University of Chile. We have seminars (+ cosmopizzas), journal clubs and more activities. Feel free send me an email to communicate with us.

#### Research Interest
I am interested in using cosmological observations to better understand our universe in order to define a more accurate theory of fundamental physics. To accomplish this goal, I am constantly studying statistical methods and new artificial intelligence tools.
I am currently doing research on flat priors in the connection of Galaxies with Matter using data from the [Dark Energy Survey (DES)](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/). 
I also collaborate in [ALeRCE](http://alerce.science/) in the area of Type Ia Supernova classification.

I am currently a member of the [Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC)](https://lsstdesc.org/) at the [Vera Rubin](https://www.lsst.org/) observatory.
