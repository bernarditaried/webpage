In this picture I am with my lovely friend Martin in our graduation! I am holding my two BSc degrees <3 


Hi! I am an astronomer and physicist in formation interested in observational cosmology. At the moment, I am a PhD student in physics (mention in Astrophysics) at Stanford University and I recently graduated from a Master in physics at the University of Chile (Domenico Sapone was my advisor). I am committed to science education and outreach. In April 2020 I founded a [free online pre-university website of mathematics](https://www.preuencuarentena.com/) because of the COVID19 pandemic and I am a science communicator of [CATA](http://www.cata.cl/).

#### Cosmology and Theoretical Astrophysics Group
I was part of the [Cosmology and Theoretical Astrophysics group](http://www.dfi.uchile.cl/grupos-investigacion/cosmologia-y-astrofisica-teorica/) of the [Physics Department](http://www.dfi.uchile.cl/) of the University of Chile. 


I am currently a member of the [Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC)](https://lsstdesc.org/) at the [Vera Rubin](https://www.lsst.org/) observatory. I worked with Aaron Roodman in understanding the cross-talk effect of the camera of this project that is being built in the north of Chile.
